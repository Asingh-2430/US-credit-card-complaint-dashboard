# Credit Card Complaint Dashboard  

### Overview  
Welcome to my **Credit Card Complaint Dashboard** project! This interactive dashboard was built using Tableau to analyze credit card complaints across the United States. It provides insights into complaint trends, categories, and resolution patterns, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions. 

### My Contribution  
I designed and developed this dashboard from scratch, focusing on creating a user-friendly interface with meaningful visualizations. By leveraging Tableau's features, I aimed to make the data accessible and actionable for users.  

### Features  
- **Interactive Visualizations**: I created dynamic charts and filters to allow users to explore the data effortlessly.  
- **Geographical Insights**: The dashboard visualizes complaint distribution across U.S. states, making it easy to identify regional trends.  
- **Trend Analysis**: Time-series visualizations reveal seasonal patterns and anomalies in complaint data.  
- **Key Metrics**: Metrics include complaint volumes, resolution times, and submission channels, all presented in an intuitive format.  

### Dataset  
- **File Name**: `Credit Card Complaints Dataset (U.S.)`  
- **Details**: The dataset includes anonymized records of credit card complaints, such as:  
  - Complaint categories and descriptions  
  - Submission methods (e.g., online, phone, mail)  
  - Resolution statuses and times  
  - Customer locations (state-level data)  

### Tools Used  
- **Tableau**: For creating the interactive dashboard.  
- **Excel**: For data cleaning and preparation.  

### How to Use  
1. Download the dataset and Tableau workbook file (`.twbx`) from this repository.  
2. Open the workbook in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader.  
3. Use the interactive filters, charts, and maps to gain insights into the data.  

### Why I Built This  
I developed this project to showcase my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights using Tableau. This project reflects my skills in data visualization, dashboard design, and storytelling through data.
